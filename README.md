# Regression Analysis Project

## Description
This project explores various regression techniques, including Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression. It provides detailed implementations and analyses of each method using relevant datasets. The project aims to help beginners understand the fundamentals of regression analysis and its applications in data science.

## Features
- **Interactive Streamlit App**: Users can select between different regression models and visualize the results.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed explanations of each regression technique and its implementation.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of the regression results to enhance understanding.

## Installation Instructions
To run the Jupyter notebooks and the Streamlit app in this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- streamlit

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment to explore the implementations of each regression technique.
2. Run the cells sequentially to understand the methodologies and results.
3. To access the Streamlit app, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run reg.py
```
4. This will launch the app in your web browser, allowing you to interact with the regression models.

## Accessing the Streamlit App
