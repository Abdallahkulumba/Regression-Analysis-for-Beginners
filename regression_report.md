## Abstract
This report provides an overview of regression analysis, a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It discusses three primary types of regression models: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression. Additionally, it references the implementation of these models in Jupyter Notebooks and a Streamlit application designed for interactive analysis.

## Introduction
Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method used to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used in various fields, including economics, biology, engineering, and social sciences, to make predictions and infer causal relationships.

## Types of Regression Models

### 1. Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a method to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It is the simplest form of regression analysis.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression by using multiple independent variables to predict the dependent variable.

### 3. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression is used when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is non-linear. It involves transforming the original features into polynomial features to capture the curvature in the data.

## Streamlit Application
To provide an interactive experience for users, I developed a Streamlit application named **"reg.py"**. This app allows users to select between the three regression models discussed above. Users can input their data and visualize the results using inbuilt trained models, making it easier to understand the implications of each regression technique.

## Conclusion
Regression analysis is a fundamental tool in data analysis and predictive modeling. The various regression techniques covered in this report—simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression—each serve unique purposes and are applicable in different scenarios. The accompanying Jupyter Notebooks and the Streamlit application provide practical implementations and visualizations to enhance understanding.
